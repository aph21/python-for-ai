# Variables
#What is variable -> it is a named reference to a value that is stored in the memory of a computer. It allows us to store and manipulate data in our programs.
#in python:
# 1) we do not declare types
# 2) Values determine the types.
# 3) Assignment used =(this isnot equality operator, it is assignment operator)

#x = 10 # this means bind the name x to the value 10 and NOT "putting 10 into x"
#y = "Anjana"
#is_student = True

#print(x)
#print(y)   
#print(is_student)


#Indentation in Python
# In python indentation is used to defined the blocks, not {} is used like other languages.
# Also this is not style it is a syntax requirement. If you do not indent properly, you will get an IndentationError.
#Incorrect Indentation = progra, crashes with an error **************
