# Learning Journal

## Day 1 - 2026-02-23
- Set up the repo and virtual environment
- Wrote first `print()` statements
- Learned about **variables** — named references to values in memory
- Python is dynamically typed: no need to declare types, values determine them
- Covered basic data types: `int`, `str`, `bool`
- Understood that `=` is assignment, not equality
- Learned **indentation** is syntax in Python, not just style — wrong indentation crashes the program
- Tried the `requests` library to make an HTTP GET call to the GitHub API
