# Learning Journal

## Day 1 - 2026-02-23
- Set up repo and virtual environment
- First `print()` statements
- **Variables** — named references to objects in memory
- Python is dynamically typed; values determine types
- `=` is assignment, `==` is equality
- **Indentation** is syntax, not style — wrong indentation crashes the program
- Used `requests` library to call the GitHub API

## Day 2 - 2026-02-24
- **Comments** — `#` for single-line; triple quotes for multiline string literals
- **Mutation vs Rebinding** — `lst.append()` mutates the original; `lst = [...]` rebinds the local name only
- **Mutable shared references** — two names pointing to the same list see each other's mutations
- **Passing mutables to functions** — function receives a reference; mutation affects caller, rebinding does not
- **Everything is an object** — each value has a type, methods, and immutability rules
- **`type()` and `isinstance()`** — `type()` returns exact class; `isinstance()` checks inheritance chain
- **Immutability** — `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool` can't be mutated; operations create new objects
- **Falsy values** — `0`, `""`, `[]`, `None` → `False`; everything else → `True`
- **`bool` is a subclass of `int`** — `True + 1 = 2`; `bool("False")` is `True` (non-empty string)
- **First functions** using `def`
